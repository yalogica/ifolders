###✨ HOW IFOLDERS PLUGIN CAN HELP YOU
There are several ways to use the iFolders plugin to organize and manage your WordPress data. Keep all your posts and pages as well as media files (images, music, videos) structured using directories and subdirectories. Organize all your data into collections by specific criteria such as date, topic, keyword or some event.

>Don't worry, the plugin doesn't change your WordPress data, it expands your ability to manage and catalog it. Adding a post, page, media or other item into a folder will do not change their data.

###☀️ BENEFITS

**Effortless Organization:** seamlessly manage your media library, posts, and pages with intuitive folder-based organization.

**Enhanced Efficiency:** save time and streamline your workflow with drag & drop functionality and bulk operations.

**Improved Visibility:** easily locate and access your content with customizable folder structures and sorting options.

**Versatile Compatibility:** Enjoy seamless integration with popular WordPress themes, plugins, and page builders.

**Image Replacement:** Forget the tedious and complicated process of replacing an image file in your WordPress media library. Previously, you had to first delete the old file, then upload a new one with the exact same name, which took time and effort. Now you can accomplish this right in the edit media file dialog box with a couple simple steps.

###🔥 FEATURES

**✅ UNLIMITED FOLDERS**
The iFolders plugin allows you to create an unlimited number of folders and subfolders that can be easily moved to suit your needs.

**✅ DRAG & DROP INTERFACE**
To organize your media library, posts, and pages even faster, you can move multiple items at once, placing them in a folder or moving folders within other folders in seconds, reducing the number of clicks required. Just quickly move and arrange items with a user-friendly interface.

**✅ BULK OPERATIONS**
Perform bulk actions such as moving multiple items or reordering folders effortlessly.

**✅ CREATE & MANAGE FOLDERS**
You can easily create new folders and organize them into a tree structure by dragging and dropping them in the desired location. This allows you to quickly organize your content the way you want.

**✅ DOWNLOAD FOLDERS AS ZIP**
Export selected folders, including their subfolders and attachment files, in a single ZIP file. The package will keep the same folder structure.

**✅ FOLDER PERMISSIONS**
Define permissions for the users or roles to perform specific actions like: view, edit, delete, and attach an item to a folder. This way you can give some users edit permissions and others only view permissions. Recommended for multi-author blogs and sites.

**✅ REPLACE MEDIA**
The plugin adds a button to the "Attachment Details" screen that allows you to select an image to replace the current image, saving its properties and URL. This makes it easy to add an updated version of the image without having to manually search and make the replacement again in the content of the post or page or anywhere else it may be mentioned.

>Note: If you find that this feature is not working properly, try disabling your browser cache and any third-party WordPress caching plugins.

**✅ CUSTOM SORTING**
Arrange items within folders by name, date, modification, or author for easy access.

**✅ SEARCH & FILTER**
Easily search and filter folders to find specific items quickly using keywords or phrases. The user can search for folders and show only those that contain a certain word or phrase in the folder name. You can use wildcards '*' or '?' which can be used to indicate many characters or a single character in the folder name.

**✅ ORGANIZE ITEMS**
You can categorize all the standard types built into WordPress including media files, posts, pages, and users to organize them more efficiently.

**✅ CUSTOM POST TYPES**
Extend folder management capabilities to custom post types for comprehensive organization. With this plugin, you will get the ability to manage and group all registered custom post types in WordPress, providing a more efficient and organized approach. Let's say you've created a new post type "Blog" or "News". With our plugin, you also get the ability to group and categorize them.

**✅ WOOCOMMERCE**
The plugin supports folders for WooCommerce listings including products, orders and coupons. This will allow you to quickly organize and manage your WooCommerce content, saving you time and effort. This is made possible because these entities are custom WordPress post types too.

**✅ FAST MEDIA MANAGEMENT**
The plugin lets you easily move media files, either individually or in large numbers, between folders. You can also quickly create, rename, delete, and organize folders to organize your content the way you want.

**✅ DIRECT UPLOAD & MANAGEMENT**
The plugin allows you to select a folder and upload new files directly into it, saving you time and effort. Another great time saver.
Upload files directly to folders and manage them efficiently within your WordPress environment.

**✅ RESPONSIVE SIDEBAR**
The plugin allows you to resize the iFolders sidebar containing folders as you wish, and turn it on or off as needed. Resize and customize the sidebar containing folders to suit your preferences for a seamless user experience.

**✅ SMART DELETE**
Easily add, rename or delete folders with a single click. If you delete a folder, your data won't be lost - it will be automatically moved to the "Uncategorized" folder, so you can access it later.

**✅ COLOR FOLDER**
Set a color for your folders to give your folder structure a couple of bright shades for clarity. Just select a folder and choose the color you want. This will allow you to make your folders more attractive with just a few clicks.

**✅ NEW FEATURES?**
If you need additional features that are not currently included in the plugin, please let us know by leaving feedback. We are always open to suggestions and may be able to implement your ideas in future versions of the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use iFolders? =
With this plugin you can easily organize posts, pages, media library and custom post types into folders. Create multiple folders and subfolders, put everything you like into them, and highlight the ones that need extra attention with a color.

= I installed the plugin, what's next? =
Once activated, the plugin will automatically enable the folder manager for the media library and user list. Just go to "Users" -> "All users" or "Media" -> "Library" screen and start organizing your items (users, media files) in the WordPress admin area. On the left will be a panel where you can manage your directories, in the toolbar click on "Plus Folder" to add the first folder, enter its name and set the color. Your first directory is ready.

= What happens when a folder is deleted? =
When you delete a folder, all items (pages, posts, media files, etc.) that were linked to that folder are not deleted. It simply removes the link between them and the folder, after which all items become available and visible in a special 'Uncategorized' virtual directory.

= If a folder is deleted will the media file in the folder be deleted too? =
No, only the folder is removed.

= Nothing happened after the image was replaced =
Most likely your browser is still caching the old image, so you are seeing the old image instead of the replaced image. Try performing a hard refresh while viewing the page (Ctrl + F5 on Windows, Apple + R / Command + R on Mac).

= Is it possible for any user to create and modify folders? =
Everything is under the control of the administrator. Our iFolders plugin has fine-grained permission settings. You can customize the folder security policy differently for each user or role. For example, some users/roles can create/view/edit folders, while others are only allowed to view them.

= Can the folders sidebar be hidden? =
Yes, if you want to hide the folder sidebar, just click the "toggle" button (above the page title of the current screen). To bring back this sidebar, press this button again.

= Does iFolders work with Gutenberg? =
Absolutely!!! iFolders is compatible with a new block editor called Gutenberg. This functionality is available out of the box even in the free version.

= Does iFolders work with page builders? =
Without a doubt, iFolders works with most popular web page builders such as Elementor, Divi, Beaver Builder, Visual Composer, WP Bakery, Brizy, Blocks and many others. If your page builder or third-party plugin uses the standard WordPress media modal dialog to select images, the plugin will also work and display folders.

= How many sites is a iFolders Pro license valid for? =
iFolders Pro license is valid for one domain (including subdomains).

= Does the plugin modify the uploads directory? =
No. The folders created by our plugin are virtual folders, so the WordPress uploads directory remains intact, as do its contents in the form of media files.

= Where is the developer version hosted? =
The developer version is avalible [here](https://github.com/yalogica/ifolders).

= I'd like access to more features and support. How can I get this? =
You can access additional features and support by visiting the CodeCanyon website and [purchasing the pro version](https://1.envato.market/getifolders). By purchasing the plugin, you get access to the full version of the iFolders WordPress plugin, automatic updates and support.

== Installation ==
Setup is easy and takes only a few minutes.

1. Download the plugin from wordpress.org, unpack it and upload the **[iFolders]** folder to your **wp-content/plugins/** directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to your main **WordPress menu > Media > Library** to create a folder and manage your files.

Best wishes, Avirtum team.
